# Amlak — project notes for Claude

Commercial-property dashboard (React / CRA + Supabase), deployed on Cloudflare.

## Deploying to production

- **Target:** Cloudflare Worker named `amlak` (serves the static `./build` directory).
- **Live URL:** https://amlak.akkawigeo-5.workers.dev
- **Steps:** `CI=true npx react-scripts build` → `npx wrangler deploy`.
- There is **no GitHub CI** — deploys happen locally via wrangler. `main` is the
  deploy branch; after deploying, commit + push so GitHub matches what's live.

## Deployment log

> **Standing instruction (George, 2026-06-30):** Every time George confirms a change
> needs to be deployed live, append a dated entry below recording what went out
> (what changed, the files, and the Cloudflare version id). Keep newest at the top.

- **2026-06-30** — Invoice email redesign + cross-account cache fix. Cloudflare version `45fb280b`.
  - `src/lib/invoiceTemplate.js` — removed the "Notes" section, cleaner letterhead/header
    (right-aligned invoice no., two-line date/due), renamed the total row to **AMOUNT DUE**,
    kept all four detail columns (monthly / annual / $·SF·mo / $·SF·yr). No AI involved.
  - `src/context/AuthContext.js` — clear the React Query cache when the signed-in user
    changes, so one account's data no longer lingers under the next.
  - `src/components/Sidebar.js` — clear cached data instantly on sign-out.
