# Amlak — project notes for Claude

Commercial-property dashboard (React / CRA + Supabase), deployed on Cloudflare.

## Working alongside other sessions

> **Standing instruction (George, 2026-06-30):** George often runs several Claude
> sessions at once, each on its own task. Sessions can't see each other directly — the
> only thing they share is this project's files and git working tree. Follow these rules
> so sessions don't trip over each other:

- **Stay on your own task.** Only touch the files your task needs. Don't refactor,
  reformat, "clean up," revert, or rename anything outside it.
- **Treat unfamiliar in-progress changes as another session's work.** If `git status`
  shows modified files that aren't part of your task, assume another session owns them
  and leave them exactly as they are.
- **Commit/deploy only your task's files.** Stage only the files you changed for your
  task. Never bundle another session's unfinished changes into a commit or push them live.
- **Only flag a real overlap.** Tell George *only* when your task must change the same
  file or feature another session is clearly working on — then pause and ask before
  proceeding. If the tasks are separate, don't mention the other session; just do your job.

> **Standing instruction (George, 2026-06-30):** George runs several sessions at
> once and can't tell the VS Code windows apart at a glance. **Begin every reply
> with a one-line status line** — at the very top, before anything else — so he
> can scan which window is doing what:
>
>     📌 [<task>] <what this session is doing right now>
>
> - **`[<task>]`** — a short, stable name for this session's overall task
>   (e.g. `[Insurance emails]`). Keep it identical all session so it lines up with
>   this window's VS Code session/tab title.
> - **`<current step>`** — a few plain words on what's happening *right now*; this
>   part changes each reply (e.g. `wiring up the dedupe`, `deploying to
>   Cloudflare`, `done — pushed`).
> - One line, plain language. It's a label for George, not part of the answer.

## Acting on a confirmed change

> **Standing instruction (George, 2026-06-30):** When George confirms a change — by
> approving a plan in plan mode, or with any plain "yes, do it" — that confirmation **is**
> the go-ahead to take it all the way live. Don't finish the code and then stop to ask
> "should I deploy this now?" Carry it through to wherever it belongs: build + deploy to
> Cloudflare, push edge functions / run migrations on Supabase, and commit + push to GitHub
> so everything matches. One confirmation covers the whole round-trip — re-asking just to
> deploy wastes George's time.
>
> **Still ask first — these need George's explicit OK before you act:**
> - **Spending money** — buying a domain or service, paid signups, billing changes, or
>   anything that incurs a real charge. (Warn about the cost, then wait.)
> - **Emailing real tenants/customers** — any email to external recipients (not George).
>   Owner-only stays the rule until a sending domain is verified.
> - **Destructive / irreversible data** — dropping tables, deleting records, or migrations
>   that lose data.
> - **Going public** — opening signup past the 2-account private-beta cap, or anything that
>   exposes the app publicly.
>
> Outside those four, treat "confirmed" as "ship it."

## Deploying to production

- **Target:** Cloudflare Worker named `amlak` (serves the static `./build` directory).
- **Live URL:** https://amlak.akkawigeo-5.workers.dev
- **Steps:** `CI=true npx react-scripts build` → `npx wrangler deploy`.
- There is **no GitHub CI** — deploys happen locally via wrangler. `main` is the
  deploy branch; after deploying, commit + push so GitHub matches what's live.

## Deployment log

> **Standing instruction (George, 2026-06-30):** Every time George confirms a change
> needs to be deployed live, append a dated entry below recording what went out
> (what changed, the files, and the Cloudflare version id). Keep newest at the top.

- **2026-06-30** — Two tenant emails + contact/email extraction. Deployed: DB migration `0033`,
  `extract-lease` edge function (Supabase `awgrjmbcghdjgnqeiqkt`), frontend Cloudflare version `692cbb61`.
  - A lease can now hold **two** emails (primary + secondary). Anywhere a tenant email is sent —
    Invoice, the bell renewal/escalation email, the "Email tenant" box — a **Primary / Second / Both**
    picker appears when a second email exists (defaults to primary; "Both" comma-joins). One email = the
    old plain field, unchanged. The daily reminder cron only emails the owner, so it's untouched.
  - `migration 0033` — `leases.tenant_email_2`, `notifications.email_to_2`, recreated `v_tenant_shares`
    with `tenant_email_2`, extended the `fill_notification_recipient` trigger to carry the 2nd email.
  - New `src/components/RecipientField.js` (the picker); wired into `InvoiceButton.js`,
    `EmailComposeModal.js`, `NotificationEmailModal.js`. Edit UI in `LeaseForm.js` + `LeaseDetailPage.js`;
    plumbing in `lib/api.js` + demo `store.js`/`mockClient.js`.
  - `extract-lease/index.ts` — now also extracts `tenant_contact_name` + two tenant-side emails (primary
    first, never the landlord's). Added a non-nullable `strField()` so the 3 new fields cost **zero**
    union-typed params — the schema was already at Anthropic's hard 16-union structured-output limit; a
    17th would 400 every extraction. `LeaseNewPage.js` maps the new fields onto the review form.
  - Note: committed only this task's files. Left `CLAUDE.md` (carries another session's pending
    status-line standing instruction + their deploy-log entries) uncommitted — flagged to George.

- **2026-06-30** — Lease upload copy tweak. Deployed: frontend Cloudflare version `19f713ec`.
  - `src/components/LeaseUpload.js` — added a one-line note under "Add a lease with AI": "Word docs and
    PDFs give the fastest, most accurate read — scans and photos work great too" (positively framed so
    scans/photos don't read as second-rate); removed the obsolete "if the file dialog doesn't open…" tip.
  - Note: the Cloudflare build was taken from the working tree, which also carried another session's
    in-progress frontend edits (`EmailComposeModal.js`, `InsuranceVault.js`, `InvoiceButton.js`,
    `LeaseForm.js`, `NotificationEmailModal.js`, `lib/api.js`, `LeaseDetailPage.js`, new
    `RecipientField.js`) — not my task; flagged to George. Committed only `LeaseUpload.js`.

- **2026-06-30** — Fix scanned-PDF AI extraction (was failing with "Edge Function returned a
  non-2xx status code"). Deployed: edge functions `extract-lease`, `extract-insurance`,
  `extract-contract`, `extract-addendum` (Supabase `awgrjmbcghdjgnqeiqkt`); frontend Cloudflare
  version `e9fad0ae`.
  - Root cause: the vision fallback asked the model to transcribe the whole document into a
    structured-output field capped at 8192 tokens, so real multi-page scans truncated → invalid
    JSON → 500. Split into two reads: a constrained fields-only call (reliable, small) + a
    separate best-effort transcription call that can't truncate the fields.
  - `functions/_shared/anthropic.ts` — new `transcribeDocument()` (non-fatal, its own call) and
    `MAX_VISION_BYTES` (20 MB guard with a friendly message past it).
  - The four `extract-*/index.ts` — vision branch now uses fields-only `SCHEMA`/`SYSTEM_FIELDS`,
    size guard, then `transcribeDocument()` for the searchable copy (George chose to keep it,
    costs a 2nd AI read per scan). Removed the unused `SCHEMA_VISION`/`SYSTEM_VISION`.
  - `src/lib/supabaseClient.js` — `invokeFunction` now reads the function's JSON `{ error }` body
    so real messages surface instead of the generic "non-2xx".
  - Note: the Cloudflare build was taken from the working tree, which also carried unrelated
    in-progress edits to `App.css`, `Sidebar.js`, `icons.js` (not my task) — flagged to George.

- **2026-06-30** — Insurance overhaul. Deployed: DB migrations `0031`+`0032`, `send-reminders` edge
  function, frontend Cloudflare version `5ca45592`.
  - Removed cost/token wording from user-facing copy (`InsuranceVault.js`, `lib/demo/mockClient.js`).
  - Landlord insurance is now property-only — removed from the lease level
    (`pages/LeaseDetailPage.js`, `PropertyInsuranceModal.js`).
  - Extra documents per policy + a Premium field; **Remove policy → Save to history** (archive) with an
    "Expired & archived" list (`InsuranceVault.js`, `lib/api.js`, migration `0032`).
  - Insurance expiry: in-app alerts already existed (wording tweak in `lib/alerts.js`); added owner
    **email** reminders with per-threshold dedupe (`functions/send-reminders/index.ts`).
  - Note: migration `0031` (beta account cap) was also applied — it was pending on the remote and is
    idempotent, so it just re-established the intended 2-account cap.

- **2026-06-30** — Invoice email redesign + cross-account cache fix. Cloudflare version `45fb280b`.
  - `src/lib/invoiceTemplate.js` — removed the "Notes" section, cleaner letterhead/header
    (right-aligned invoice no., two-line date/due), renamed the total row to **AMOUNT DUE**,
    kept all four detail columns (monthly / annual / $·SF·mo / $·SF·yr). No AI involved.
  - `src/context/AuthContext.js` — clear the React Query cache when the signed-in user
    changes, so one account's data no longer lingers under the next.
  - `src/components/Sidebar.js` — clear cached data instantly on sign-out.
