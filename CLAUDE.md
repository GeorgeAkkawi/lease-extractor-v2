# Amlak — project notes for Claude

Commercial-property dashboard (React / CRA + Supabase), deployed on Cloudflare.

## Working alongside other sessions

> **Standing instruction (George, 2026-06-30):** George often runs several Claude
> sessions at once, each on its own task. Sessions can't see each other directly — the
> only thing they share is this project's files and git working tree. Follow these rules
> so sessions don't trip over each other:

- **Stay on your own task.** Only touch the files your task needs. Don't refactor,
  reformat, "clean up," revert, or rename anything outside it.
- **Treat unfamiliar in-progress changes as another session's work.** If `git status`
  shows modified files that aren't part of your task, assume another session owns them
  and leave them exactly as they are.
- **Commit/deploy only your task's files.** Stage only the files you changed for your
  task. Never bundle another session's unfinished changes into a commit or push them live.
- **Only flag a real overlap.** Tell George *only* when your task must change the same
  file or feature another session is clearly working on — then pause and ask before
  proceeding. If the tasks are separate, don't mention the other session; just do your job.

## Deploying to production

- **Target:** Cloudflare Worker named `amlak` (serves the static `./build` directory).
- **Live URL:** https://amlak.akkawigeo-5.workers.dev
- **Steps:** `CI=true npx react-scripts build` → `npx wrangler deploy`.
- There is **no GitHub CI** — deploys happen locally via wrangler. `main` is the
  deploy branch; after deploying, commit + push so GitHub matches what's live.

## Deployment log

> **Standing instruction (George, 2026-06-30):** Every time George confirms a change
> needs to be deployed live, append a dated entry below recording what went out
> (what changed, the files, and the Cloudflare version id). Keep newest at the top.

- **2026-06-30** — Insurance overhaul. Deployed: DB migrations `0031`+`0032`, `send-reminders` edge
  function, frontend Cloudflare version `5ca45592`.
  - Removed cost/token wording from user-facing copy (`InsuranceVault.js`, `lib/demo/mockClient.js`).
  - Landlord insurance is now property-only — removed from the lease level
    (`pages/LeaseDetailPage.js`, `PropertyInsuranceModal.js`).
  - Extra documents per policy + a Premium field; **Remove policy → Save to history** (archive) with an
    "Expired & archived" list (`InsuranceVault.js`, `lib/api.js`, migration `0032`).
  - Insurance expiry: in-app alerts already existed (wording tweak in `lib/alerts.js`); added owner
    **email** reminders with per-threshold dedupe (`functions/send-reminders/index.ts`).
  - Note: migration `0031` (beta account cap) was also applied — it was pending on the remote and is
    idempotent, so it just re-established the intended 2-account cap.

- **2026-06-30** — Invoice email redesign + cross-account cache fix. Cloudflare version `45fb280b`.
  - `src/lib/invoiceTemplate.js` — removed the "Notes" section, cleaner letterhead/header
    (right-aligned invoice no., two-line date/due), renamed the total row to **AMOUNT DUE**,
    kept all four detail columns (monthly / annual / $·SF·mo / $·SF·yr). No AI involved.
  - `src/context/AuthContext.js` — clear the React Query cache when the signed-in user
    changes, so one account's data no longer lingers under the next.
  - `src/components/Sidebar.js` — clear cached data instantly on sign-out.
