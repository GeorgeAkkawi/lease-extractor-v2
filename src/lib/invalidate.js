// One place that knows what goes stale when a BILLED figure moves.
//
// Every money screen in the app is downstream of a handful of stored figures, but the
// chain isn't visible from the component you happen to be editing — so each editor grew
// its own hand-rolled invalidation list, and the lists drifted apart by omission. That
// drift is exactly how a stored invoice could keep billing last month's figures while
// the Financials breakdown and the Ledger grid (which build UP from live data) had
// already moved on.
//
// Call this after anything that changes what a tenant is billed: a lease money field, a
// rent step, an abatement, the building size, a CAM / tax / roof total. It covers the
// SHARED consequences only — each editor still invalidates its own list (escalations,
// camLineItems, …), because that part genuinely is local to it.
//
// Deliberately separate from settleStatementImport (ImportStatementButton.js), which is
// a wider statement-specific set: an import also touches the import register, learned
// payee rules and the property's history. Two named sets beat one that fits neither.
